# Xcode Project Setup Instructions

The biomaTIMER app code is complete, but the Xcode project file needs to be created properly through Xcode itself.

## How to Set Up the Project

1. **Open Xcode**
2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Choose "iOS" platform
   - Select "App" template
   - Product Name: `biomaTIMER`
   - Bundle Identifier: `com.rtasseff.biomaTIMER`
   - Language: Swift
   - Interface: SwiftUI
   - Use Core Data: ✅ (checked)
   - Include Tests: ✅ (checked)

3. **Replace the Generated Files**:
   - Delete the auto-generated files
   - Copy all files from the `biomaTIMER/` directory into your Xcode project
   - Add the files to the project target by dragging them into Xcode

4. **Add Live Activity Extension**:
   - File → New → Target → Widget Extension
   - Name: `TimerLiveActivity`
   - Include Live Activities: ✅ (checked)
   - Replace the generated files with the contents from `TimerLiveActivity/`

5. **Project Configuration**:
   - Set iOS Deployment Target to 17.5+
   - Enable Live Activities in Info.plist (already configured)
   - Add background modes for timer persistence (already configured)

## File Structure to Add to Xcode

```
biomaTIMER/
├── biomaTIMERApp.swift (App entry point)
├── ContentView.swift (Main tab view)
├── Models/
│   └── TimerModel.swift
├── Views/
│   ├── MainTimerView.swift
│   ├── ProjectEditorView.swift
│   ├── HistoryView.swift
│   └── SettingsView.swift
├── Services/
│   ├── TimerService.swift
│   ├── PersistenceController.swift
│   └── BackgroundTaskService.swift
├── Extensions/
│   └── Date+Extensions.swift
└── DataModel.xcdatamodeld (Core Data model)
```

## Live Activity Extension Files

```
TimerLiveActivity/
├── TimerLiveActivity.swift
├── TimerLiveActivityBundle.swift
└── Info.plist
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites:
- **biomaTIMERTests**: Unit tests for business logic
- **biomaTIMERUITests**: UI tests for user flows

Once set up in Xcode, you can run tests with Cmd+U and build with Cmd+B.

## Features Implemented

✅ Work timer with start/stop/reset
✅ Project timers with custom colors
✅ Live Activities for lock screen display
✅ Core Data local storage
✅ History with daily/weekly/monthly reports
✅ CSV export via Share Sheet
✅ Battery-optimized implementation
